# Program 1 Write Up

### Efficiency Writeup
- The purpose of program 1 was to implement a game using object oriented programming
  methods. This allows for seperation of responsiblity and roles within the game and when
implemented correctly, it can result in less code and simpler maintenance for future
developers among other benefits. A key part to being successful with programming in this
style is to carefully plan and delegate responsibilities for all the classes that are going
to be implemented. With careful planning in place, I then (as Karla loves to say) "found
the similiarities, and pushed them up". This creates hierarchies of objects that when used allows
for some very efficient and concise functions to be written.
