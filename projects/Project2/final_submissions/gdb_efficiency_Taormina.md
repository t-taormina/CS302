### Efficiency Writeup
- The purpose of this program was to implement a data structure and a object hierarchy in order to provide a user information about various winter activities in the local area. The activities that I decided to include in my hierarchy are skiing, snowshoeing, and ice skating. The data structure is a doubly linked list using templates. This allows one implementation of the linked list to be used with all three data types thus greatly reducing the amount of code needed to make thi project possible.
