# Exception Handling 
- allows for more control of the flow of the program
- errors are detected with an "if" statement
- "throw" keyword is used to change the flow  
  - how much code should be skipped? 
  - unwind the stack until we get back to where the code makes sense 
- there will also be a "try" and "catch" keywords used 
-
