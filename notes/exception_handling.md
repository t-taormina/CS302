# Exception Handling 
- allows for more control of the flow of the program
- errors are detected with an "if" statement
- "throw" keyword is used to change the flow  
  - how much code should be skipped? 
  - unwind the stack until we get back to where the code makes sense 
- "try" keyword is used before the "if"
- "catch" is used to respond to the throw
- catch(...) will catch everything
- exception handling is important when using operator overloading 
- instead of throwing a success/failure flag for a function, throw an exception
