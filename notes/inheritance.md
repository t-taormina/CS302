# Inheritance lecture
- inheritance involves making use of a base and derived class (or a super and sub class)
- the base class contains the similarities and the derived class contains the differences 
- think... base class: vehicle 
  - and derived classes: car, bike, train, boat, etc. 
- classes can contain three levels of restriction for the data that they contain 
  - public = accessbile for everyone (client accessible; public derivation gives access to public funtions of the base class)
  - protected = accessible for derived classes
  - private = only accessible by the particular class
- every class needs to have a purpose or job to do 
- AVOID GETTERS!
