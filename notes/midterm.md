# Midterm 1 CS302
- in person
- 80 minutes
- topics to be covered on the exam

### OOP
- what kind of relationships?
  - "contains a" and "is a"
- what is the issue with "getters"?
  - harder to maintain
  - generally ends up being more code
  - passes responsibility of a classes data to another class
  - does the class recieving the data know what to do with it? why?
- what does it mean for an object to change spontaneously?
- what advantages do we have from a hierarchy?
  - everything in the base class flows through to the derived
  - all public methods in the hierarchy are available to the client
  - containing functions can do the same thing but end up needing wrapper functions and results in more code


### Single inheritance
- base vs derived class
- what does a derived class inherit?
- what can a derived class access?
- what can the client access?
  - public of entire hierarchy
- what if members have the same name?
  - derived member of the same name hides the parent member of the same name
  - would have to use the parents name and "::" to access (ParentName::memberName)
  -


### Copy Constructors
- what is a copy constuctor?
- why is it important?
- what is the syntax?
- what would cause it to be invoked?
  - pass by value, return by value, create an object with another object as the initial value 

### Data structures
- Linear linked list algorithms
- Circular linked list algorithms
- for both
  - remove the last node
  - remove the first and last node
  - remove every other node
  - add a node to the end
  - copy the data structure

### Python
- differences between python and c++
- what does it mean to be dynamically typed language?
- how to go about programming in python
  - solving a problem using python syntax

### References to study
- labs 1, 2, 3
- prelab quiz 2,3
- review power point slides 1,3
