# Operator Overloading
- allows us the ability to program what an operator does when using abstractions
  - what does it mean for two car objects to be compared?  (car1 > car2) 
- lots of rules with operator overloading
- what operators make sense?
- what is the residual value?
  - this is the return type
- is the result an R or L value?
  - R value: return by value
  - L value: return by reference
- does the current object change?
  - if not, make it a const member function
- distinction to be made when using operators with members and non-members
